# Final Project for Specialization choose module
## Task is to convert array in to different array only with values that are equal or less then 3 symbols.
1. There is a choice how to fullfill array - automatic (input *'Y'*) or manually (input *'N'*).
2. After that the origin array will be analized for the number of the values that are equal to 3 symbols.
3. Than new array will be created and fullfilled with the filtered elements.
